<h1>Electricity Data Management Project โก</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the repository of the <strong>Electricity Data Management Project</strong>, a comprehensive application designed to manage and analyze daily electricity records for the Gaza Strip. This project addresses the chronic electricity deficit and its impact on living conditions, providing a user-friendly interface for managing and analyzing electricity data. The data, provided by the Gaza Electricity Distribution Company (GEDCO), is used to track and analyze variations in electricity demand based on temperature and other factors.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Management Screen:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Insert New Record:</strong> Add a new electricity record to the dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Update Existing Record:</strong> Modify details of an existing electricity record.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete Record:</strong> Remove a specific electricity record from the dataset.</li>
    <li><strong>Search by Date:</strong> Locate a specific electricity record using a calendar GUI to select the date.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Statistics Screen:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Daily Statistics:</strong> View specific electricity statistics for a given day across all months and years.</li>
    <li><strong>Monthly Statistics:</strong> Access statistics for a given month across all days and years.</li>
    <li><strong>Yearly Statistics:</strong> Obtain statistics for a given year across all days and months.</li>
    <li><strong>Total Statistics:</strong> View aggregate statistics for all data, including total sum, average, maximum, and minimum values.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Save Screen:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Save Data:</strong> Save the updated linked lists back to a new file in CSV format, using a file chooser to select the save location.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Structure:</strong> Implement a combined sorted linked list to manage and organize the electricity data efficiently. Note that arrays and ArrayLists are not used.</li>
    <li><strong>Graphical User Interface:</strong> Build the GUI using JavaFX, without the use of Scene Builder, for a responsive and interactive user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>File Handling:</strong> Load data from and save data to CSV files, using file choosers for both operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> This project specifically utilizes linked lists to handle and manipulate the electricity data, ensuring efficient data management and operations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Performance Considerations</h2>
<p>
    Each functionality in this project has been designed with attention to time complexity. Ensure you understand the performance characteristics of each function, including insertion, deletion, updating, searching, and statistical calculations, as you will be expected to explain them during discussions.
